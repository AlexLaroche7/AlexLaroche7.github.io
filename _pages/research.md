During my undergrad, I was involved in projects working on dark matter constraints via strong gravitational lensing and 21cm cosmology, both theory and experiment. These projects are summarized below:

## Dark matter and strong gravitational lensing
----
Four decades after Vera Rubin discovered overwhelming evidence for the existence of dark matter, astrophysicists are still grappling with the question: what is dark matter made of? This is especially concerning since dark matter is thought to be five times more abundant than ordinary matter! While cold dark matter (CDM) can explain observations of large-scale structure in our Universe, small-scale challenges to CDM have motivated a variety of alternative dark matter theories.

In recent years, strong gravitational lensing has emerged as an effective tool for constraining dark matter models. When the light from a distant quasar is lensed by an intervening galaxy, the original image of the quasar can sometimes be split into four lensed images. Hence, we often refer to these systems as 'quadruple-image quasars'. The relative brightnesses of these quad images (flux ratios) are extremely sensitive to the dark matter content in the lensing galaxy. This is particularly useful since many alternative dark matter models only deviate from cold dark matter (CDM) on sub-galactic scales.

### Constraining ultra-light dark matter with quadruple image quasars
----
Ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) is a dark matter canditate made of ultra-light bosons, such as axions, in which particles have a mass $m<10^{-20}$ eV. These particles are so light that quantum mechanical effects can manifest on galactic scales. The kpc-scale de Broglie wavelength of ULDM particles creates wave-like density fluctuations in the density profiles of ULDM halos. Under the supervision of [Daniel Gilman](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~gilman/) and [Jo Bovy](https://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/), I developed the first strong lensing ULDM model to account for these fluctuations. In our paper [_Quantum fluctuations masquerade as halos: Bounds on ultra-light dark matter from quadruply-imaged quasars_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11269), we demonstrated that fluctuations in ULDM can significantly impact image flux ratios, and present lower bounds on the ultra-light boson mass.

## 21cm cosmology
----
Observations of the redshifted 21cm line have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the early Universe. 21cm cosmologists are primarily interested in measuring (i) 21cm intensity maps; the 21cm photon distrubition as a function of space and time, and (ii) the 21cm global signal; an all-sky measurement of the 21cm line. 

### Constraining density-ionization correlations during the Epoch of Reionization
----
I completed my undergraduate thesis, titled "Quantifying Density-Ionization Correlations with the 21cm Power Spectrum While Including X-ray Heating Effects," under the supervision of [Adrian Liu](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~acliu/). The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a period in the Universe's history when neutral hydrogen was systematically ionized. Reionization did not occur uniformly throughout Universe. Rather, small ionized bubbles formed and grew to eventually ionize the entire intergalactic medium. The relationship between these ionized bubbles (the ionization field) and the matter density field during the EoR can be understood with 21cm intensity mapping, but has yet to be constrained by experiments. My thesis showed that upcoming measurements of the 21cm power spectrum with the [Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)](https://reionization.org/) will be able to constrain density-ionization correlations, while incorporating X-ray heating effects.

### Measuring the global 21cm signal with PRIZM
----
While working as a research assistant in the McGill Radio Lab, under the supervision of [Jonathan Sievers](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~sievers/), I performed data selection and analysis for the [Probing Radio Intensity at high-Z from Marion (PRIZM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09531) experiment. PRIZM is a global 21cm telescope which seeks to measure the global 21cm signal during Cosmic Dawn, a loosely defined period in the Universe's history (including the EoR) when the first stars formed and 'lit up' our previously dark Universe. Clean measurements of global 21cm signal are _very_ hard to achieve. For instance, experiments must contend with radio frequency interference (RFI) and galactic foregrounds. My work involed writing code to efficiently process both on-sky spectra and antenna data.
