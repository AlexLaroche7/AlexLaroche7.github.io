Greetings! Welcome to my website.

My name is Alex Laroche and I am a first year PhD student at the [University of Toronto (UofT)](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in the [Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/). 

Prior to joining UofT, I received my BSc in Honours [Physics](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/) from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in 2022.

During my undergrad, I was primarily interested in strong gravitational lensing, dark matter and 21cm cosmology. I worked in both [Adrian Liu's](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~acliu/) and [Jonathan Sievers'](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~sievers/) groups at McGill and [Jo Bovy's](https://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/) group at UofT. If you would like to read more about my research click [here](/research).

If you would like to contact me, send me an [email](mailto:alex.laroche@mail.utoronto.ca).
