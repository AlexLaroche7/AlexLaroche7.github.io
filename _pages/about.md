Hello,

And welcome to my world wide website.

I'm Alex Laroche. Third year PhD candidate, [NSERC CGS-D Scholar](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/nserc-crsng/fundingdecisions-decisionsfinancement/scholarshipsandfellowships-concoursdebourses/index_eng.asp), and [DSI Doctoral Student Fellow](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/data-sciences-institute-announces-doctoral-student-fellows-for-2024/) at the [University of Toronto (UofT)](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in the [Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/) supervised by [Maria Drout](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~drout/) & [Josh Speagle](https://joshspeagle.com/). 

My research focuses on binary interaction: how the exchange of mass, energy and momentum between two stars in a binary drastically impacts their evolution and ultimate fates. First, I am interested in developing data-driven techniques capable of sifting through large-scale surveys to discover new, rare populations of binaries which can then be leveraged to constrain binary evolution. Second, I use a combination of observations and theoretical modeling to meticulously examine smaller samples of interacting binaries in order to understand their past and future evolution. Current binaries of interest include [binary-stripped helium stars](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.ade4970) and (some) [carbon-enhanced metal poor stars](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/3/4049/7191262).

I grew up in Montreal, Quebec. Previously, I graduated from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in 2022 with an Honours Bachelor of Science in [Physics]((https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/)). During my undergrad, my research interests primarily involved dark matter, strong gravitational lensing and 21cm cosmology. I worked in both [Adrian Liu's](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~acliu/) and [Jonathan Sievers'](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~sievers/) groups at McGill, and [Jo Bovy's](https://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/) group at UofT. 

Beyond astrophysics, I enjoy running...as fast as possible (5/10/HM/M: 16:12/33:59/1:16/2:41).
