     abstract = "Ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) refers to a class of theories, including
        ultra-light axions, in which particles with mass $m_{\psi} <
        10^{-20}\, \rm{eV}$ comprise a significant fraction of the dark
        matter. A galactic scale de Broglie wavelength distinguishes
        these theories from cold dark matter (CDM), suppressing the
        overall abundance of structure on sub-galactic scales, and
        producing wave-like interference phenomena in the density
        profiles of halos. With the aim of constraining the particle
        mass, we analyze the flux ratios in a sample of eleven
        quadruple-image strong gravitational lenses. We account for the
        suppression of the halo mass function and concentration-mass
        relation predicted by ULDM theories, and the wave-like
        fluctuations in the host halo density profile, calibrating the
        model for the wave interference against numerical simulations of
        galactic-scale halos. We show that the granular structure of
        halo density profiles, in particular, the amplitude of the
        fluctuations, significantly impacts image flux ratios, and
        therefore inferences on the particle mass derived from these
        data. We infer relative likelihoods of CDM to ULDM of 8:1, 7:1,
        6:1, and 4:1 for particle masses
        $\log_{10}(m_\psi/\rm{eV})\in[-22.5,-22.25],
        [-22.25,-22.0],[-22.0,-21.75], [-21.75,-21.5]$, respectively.
        Repeating the analysis and omitting fluctuations associated with
        the wave interference effects, we obtain relative likelihoods of
        CDM to ULDM with a particle mass in the same ranges of 98:1,
        48:1, 26:1 and 18:1, highlighting the significant perturbation
        to image flux ratios associated with the fluctuations.
        Nevertheless, our results disfavor the lightest particle masses
        with $m_{\psi} < 10^{-21.5}\,\rm{eV}$, adding to mounting
        pressure on ultra-light axions as a viable dark matter
        candidate.",
